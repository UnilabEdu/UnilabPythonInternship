<div class="introduction">
    <p>Hi guys! My name is Sandro and I am from Tbilisi, Georgia.
        <br />This top is made according to my personal experience and tries to cover all aspects of hiking in Georgia.<br /></p>
    <p>Now a bit about me:</p>
</div>

<div class="description">
    <p>I am a 25 years old guy, working at an international organisation. Student of International Relations.
        Currently, I am studying at the Ilia State University.  Mostly interested in Data Science and Python.
        Lived in Germany, Portugal and Ukraine. From end of March 2021 based in my hometown Tbilisi, Georgia.
        <br/><br/>
        <br/> As you can understand from this website I really like hiking and climbing. Explored almost all trails in Georgia
        and nearby countries. Now thinking more about mountaineering.<br/>

        <br/> Also I like travelling (especially by bicycle)üòäüòç. I cycled around the Black Sea and Marmara sea
        and through Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Armenia. Visited around 30 countries.
        <br/>I am an open-minded, active and creative person. Always ready to share my experience and to tell you about my country.

        I am ready for new meetings and people. Of course I can give you some advice about routes and trails in Georgia and neighbour countries.<br/>
