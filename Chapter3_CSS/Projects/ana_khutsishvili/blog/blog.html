        <li><h3>Veterinarian visits</h3></li>
            <p>
                Responsible pet ownership starts with regular visits to the veterinarian. Given their shorter-than-human lifespan,
                your dog or cat should be getting a checkup at least <b>once or twice a year.</b>
                <br />Trips to the vet can be, shall we say, challenging. Cats, in particular, may be averse to leaving the comfy
                confines of their home, but there are ways to reduce stress for both of you.
            </p>
        <li><h3>Vaccinations</h3></li>
            <p>Vaccinating your pets is a vital component of responsible pet care. Soon after welcoming your new pet into your home,
                schedule an immunization appointment.
                <br />During your first visit, the vet will set up an immunization schedule for your little pup or kitten to protect
                them from illness and disease.
            </p>
        <li><h3>Proper identification</h3></li>
        <p>
            If the unthinkable happens and your little guy or gal gets lost â€” youngsters in particular are prone to dashing out
            the door â€” having proper identification is the key to a happy ending.
            <br />Start with the basics: <b>a safe collar, and a tag</b> that contains all of your contact information.
        </p>
